# es-theme-steampunk

OVERVIEW

This ZIP package contains the Steampunk theme that is to be used within Emulation Station.

**NOTE**

You do not always have to put Emulation Station themes in the standard /etc/emulationstation/themes location.

Emulation Station provides additional support for placing them into a different folder.  The benefit of using this
different folder is that the default user "pi" has full read/write access.  You no longer have to be user "root" to
copy over files or swap out files.  

By default, this new "themes" folder does not exist, so simply create it.

/opt/retropie/configs/all/emulationstation/themes

**NOTE**
You can also access this same folder by navigating this hidden folder
   
/home/pi/.emulationstation
